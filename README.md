## NF26
Data analisis of the taxis running in the city of Porto, in Portugal (link [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taxi+Service+Trajectory+-+Prediction+Challenge,+ECML+PKDD+2015)). A set of real data from 2015 with more than 1 700 000 records described by 9 measurements. The purpose of this set of data and this analysis was to improve customer satisfaction regarding the waiting time and to be more competitive and profitable in the transport business. We clean, prepare and store the data in a cassandra database. Finally we did an offline k-means to retrieve the most important clusters of rides, plot them using a `python` lib called *Folium* and analyse them.
